## Scenario
Your CEO has decided that the company needs a full-time data scientist, and possibly a team of them in
the future. She thinks she needs someone who can help drive data science within the entire
organization and could potentially lead a team in the future. She understands that data scientist salaries
vary widely across the world and is unsure what to pay them. To complicate matters, salaries are going
up due to the great recession and the market is highly competitive. Your CEO has asked you to prepare
an analysis on data science salaries and provide them with a range to be competitive and get top talent.
The position can work offshore, but the CEO would like to know what the difference is for a person
working in the United States. Your company is currently a small company but is expanding rapidly.

## Deliverables
Prepare your analysis in an Jupyter notebook . Your final product should be a PowerPoint (or Google
Slides) presentation giving your recommendation to the CEO. CEOs do not care about your code and
don’t want to see it. They want to see visuals and a well-thought-out analysis. They also want very
concise presentations, the total length must be 4 to 6 pages in PowerPoint.
Note: You can add an appendix after the end of the main presentation, if there are details that just don’t
fit into the main presentation. The appendix, if used, must be clearly as an appendix. The appendix
does not count toward the grade.
Use of an appendix like this in a “real world” presentation allows you to have a highly professional way
to answer questions you think your audience may ask by pulling up a table or graphic related to that
question.
You will need to turn in the Presentation deck and the code as a Jupyter Notebook in pdf format.
